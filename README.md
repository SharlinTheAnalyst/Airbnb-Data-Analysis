Toronto Airbnb Data Analysis
Project Overview

This project presents the successful implementation of data analysis techniques to visualize and interpret insights from an official Airbnb dataset. Our team of four professionals, with expertise in finance, business analysis, and data analytics, combined technical skills with business acumen to uncover meaningful trends in Airbnb listings.

The analysis encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of various data visualization methods to tell a compelling, data-driven story. By exploring factors such as pricing, neighborhood, and amenities, this project provides valuable insights for Airbnb hosts, investors, and stakeholders in the real estate and hospitality sectors.
